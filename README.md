![preview](6073691566546710528.jpg)

Linki is an open standard for physical medium of digital content.

Linki is a rectangular object of any material linking to online content through a NFC tag. Everybody are free to create, release, sell their own linkies for music, video, streams, games, apps etc. Linki is built on the technologies of the web - it uses URLs and NFC to combine the physical and virtual worlds.

Linkies are usable with smartphones with NFC support or with [open hardware linki players](https://github.com/timotoots/linki_players).

Linki is an open source design project initiated by artist [Timo Toots](https://www.timo.ee) and his [Studio Masinism](https://www.masinism.ee). Collaborators welcome to join!
